	1.Implicit Wait
	2.Explicit Wait
	3.Fluent Wait
	
	If you declare Implicit Wait in Selenium, it will check for each and every element. 
	If we are given 60 Seconds of time to search for elements, it will keep on searching to found an element and once the element is found in 30 seconds then implicit wait will release.
	And next it will wait for other element.If the element is not found it throws "NoSuchElementException".

	If we declare Explicit Wait in Selenium, it will check for only one or particular element.
	If we are given 60 Seconds of time to search per element, it will keep on searching to found an element and once the element is found in 30 seconds then implicit wait will release.
	It will work for only one element not for all.

	The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded before throwing “ElementNotVisibleException” exception. 
	It is an intelligent kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements.
	It gives better options than implicit wait as it waits for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

 	Fluent Wait looks for a web element repeatedly at regular intervals until timeout happens or until the element is found.
	If the element is found,It does not wait out the entire duration defined in the code.
